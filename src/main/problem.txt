Pre-interview exercise

This exercise is designed to demonstrate the skills a candidate
has learned for writing clear and readable programs which model
complex problem domains and which can be easily modified in the
face of changing requirements. These skills are critically
important for the role.

Neither the size of the submitted program nor the time taken to
complete the exercise are considered to be important, but to give
an estimate it should take candidates approximately one hour and
involve writing approximately 200 lines of code, excluding tests,
comments, punctuation and whitespace.

Maximum credit will be given for a program which is clearly
written with minimal duplication and which demonstrates good
object-oriented design practice including the use of appropriate
design patterns. Part of the interview process will be a review
of the submitted program, and topics for discussion will include
justifying particular design decisions and testing strategies,
and demonstrating how the program may be extended to handle new
requirements. The program must be the candidate's own work, and
the interview will include questions to ensure that this is the
case.

The submission may make use of any widely-available programming
languages, although the use of C# is strongly encouraged. Credit
will not be given for using third-party libraries to solve the
problem: the ideal solution only uses library code for reading
and writing files and for formatting text.

Problem description: Write a program which reads in descriptions
of tennis matches and displays the current score in each match.

The program should take two arguments on the command line:
respectively the name of an input file and the name of an output
file.

Each line of the input file is a description of a tennis match
between two players named 'A' and 'B', and comprises a sequence
of 'A's and 'B's which indicates the winner of each point in the
match in the order that they are played.

For each line in the input, the program should write a line to
the output in the format:

[completed set scores] [score in current set] [score in current game]

For example: 3-6 6-4 0-2 0-15
                         ^^^^ score in current game
                     ^^^ score in current set
             ^^^^^^^ scores in completed sets

Each score is shown in the form 'n-m' where 'n' is the server's
score and 'm' is the receiver's score. The server changes at the
end of each game, and player A serves first.

The score in points in the current game is omitted if it is 0-0.

The score in games in the current set is shown even if it is 0-0.

An advantage score is shown 40-A or A-40.

There is no tiebreak in any set.

An example input file, and the corresponding output file, is
included. The submitted program is expected to produce a
character-for-character copy of this output file from this input
file, so careful attention must be paid to whitespace characters.

The input file can be assumed to only comprise lines of sequences
of 'A's and 'B's which form matches which have not been won by
either player. It is not required to handle gracefully any other
format of input.

The rules of tennis scoring may be found online at [1]. For this
exercise, the match is won by the best of three sets and each set
is won by two clear games. There is no tiebreak in any set.

Candidates unfamiliar with the rules of tennis may request an
alternative exercise.
